Storage for [Dan Phiffer](https://twitter.com/danphiffer)'s Tracery code. Just in case.

# About

Dan Phiffer is a silly twitter bot (an "evil twin" of @mediabounds) hosted by [Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/), which is run by [George Buckenham](https://twitter.com/v21). Bots there are "coded" in [Tracery](http://brightspiral.com/), made by [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/). This is a great way to ruin a dumb joke by tweeting it periodically!
